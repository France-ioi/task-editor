so when we add bebras types of tasks, the editor should make it easy to edit:
- the title (in the title element and h1 element)
- the list of imported modules
- all the fields in the json variable
- all the strings in the strings variable
- the task statement between the h1 element and tabsContainer id (empty in this case)
- the window.stringsLanguage value
- the content of gridInfos
- the content of subTask.data

we would describe the structure of all this data with a json schema, with enumerations for the fields
such as language, imported module, blocks etc. so that people just need to select from a list

provide the html template with the placeholders, and a json file describing how to insert
the data provided by the editor, into the html template, and produce exactly the index.html and task.js files
we have in test-p5

if we write the schema, https://github.com/jdorn/json-editor can already be used to edit everything easily

so we need the script that takes the json output of that editor, the template and the substitution description,
and generates the output files (index.html and task.js)

1) setup the json-editor, make the wysiwyg feature work so we can edit html fields with the html editor.
2) write the script that takes the content.json (output of the editor),
    the html template and the substitution description file, and generates the html output.
    we'll also need to output a separate json file with some of the data in content.json
3) integrate it in an interface with several tabs :
    a) an import/export tab: - to provide the path of the task relative to a root folder
        - a button to load a task that already has a content.json file, with error messages when appropriate
        - a button to save the json of the currently edited task, and to apply the generation script
        - fields to input your svn credentials and buttons to update or commit the task from svn
    b) the json-editor tab
    c) (at the end) the files tab, where you can upload images or other files,
        remove some, and delete some, from the task folder
